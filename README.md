# Jordan's Game

By: Stella Marie

Pokemon parody rpg made with React and Phaser

## Description

**Inspired by:** Pokemon Red
**Spec by:** Jordan (my nephew)
**Design by:** Stella Marie (Sm Kou)

### Project Setup

User Input
- game menu
- gamepad
- dialog (narration)
- dialog options
- keyboard: keypress | button

What data is passed when game state changes or when controls are used?

    To setup the Start screen requires a dialog and two options: new game and load game. Depending on whether the player has played through the introduction scenes, if the boolean flags are all true, new game opens a delete confirmation modal, while load game loads the last scene played. Otherwise, new game loads the introduction scenes and load game is disabled.
