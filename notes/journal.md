Geo bonding

Geo
: standard, shiny, or sweet
: dark or light
: regular or legendary

Every geo has 5 moves they will know by their final evolution, which differ based on their preference of light or dark.
1. 3 moves
2. +1
3. +1
Standard: stronger (more damage)
Shiny: faster (higher speed and evasion, bonus on related defense and attack)
Sweet: more effective (heal more, recover faster, higher tolerance, overcome type disadvantages)

When does a geo evolve and what is the advantage between evolving earlier or later?
- cause:
  - team support: evolves to support team and battles
  - temple stone: forces evolution
- evolve when possible: gain move advantage based on level
  evolve later: gain variant advantage equal to levels skipped

### Lexicon

Pe'um: A person or humanoid.

Geo: A creature that transitions at will between a living totem and its mobile form. They do not require food or drink, and do not reproduce, instead subsisting on and so gathering around memo (m'm). They have battle stats, abilities, and traits. When they communicate, whether another geo, pe'um or fig, they can only pronounce single consonants and vowels. 

Fig: A being made purely of memo, a charged substance akin to spirit or magic. They often serve a function to nature and while they appear to both geos and pe'um, they rarely engage with them beyond their function. They speak the formal language of geos that geos cannot fully pronounce.

### Character consideration

Memo can equate to life force. Once completely dispelled, a creature dies. Creatures retain memo longer than non-living things. If objectives...rather than objectives, ent years equate to memo left.

Ghost types can directly attack memo.

Stats:
- HP
- Charge | Hunger and thirst
- Power (sleep)
- Spirit => memo
- Attack
- Defense
- Speed
- Evasion
- Level

Dark geos: no defense or support moves
Light geos: no attack moves

Original pokemon:
- conversation: get information, make a trade, engage in battle

What do characters do?
- tend, gather and cook plants
- mix colors
- refine fibers for thread and rope
- mine ores and minerals
- do art: paint, dye, build
- buy and sell goods
- appeal and capture geos
- battle and train geos

What do characters have?
- clothing
- house
- geos
- family members

Special characters:
- Psychotherapist
- Geo linguist

### Notes

Every character has a routine and objectives. As they follow routines, they check if they have completed the first objective in their objectives. Once an objective has been reached, it is removed from their objectives. If a character has no more objectives, they die. Objectives equate to years. The older a character is, the less objectives they have.

Game loop:
- List every character in player area
- Update every character: character.do()
- Update player with input

Reactions:
- routine-based
- stats-based
- memory-based

Actions:
- speak
- walk
- run
- check
- activate
  - ent(fig, peum, geo): "What are you doing?"
  - nent(obj): use, open-close, knock, up-down

Micro-actions:
- identify
- scan
- spot

Processes:
- navigate
- battle
- seek geos
- make something
- read something

Ex. Lead player outside for geo battle
- Process components: path, walk, door
- Options: follow edges or next open space
- Options: check|navigate and move, move and check|navigate

Geos can speak
but can become inactive (totem form)

## 2024-1-30

Research indicates the collective results of either experiments and/or observations. If a player were to conduct research, they would need a manner of taking notes, otherwise they are likely to repeat themselves. So research is not a viable component of the game.

In the original game, Pokemon encourages the player to catch every pokemon to complete the pokedex with Prof. Oak, the instigator, being a researcher and supposedly using the player's results for research.

Therapist
eg. "Looks like you've got a stubborn geo. You will not be able to train them until they learn that winning is more important than their pride in winning. That means they need to suffer a devastating loss. I suggest going against a geo or peum you know you can't win against and lead your team to try their best. But be careful. If you wait for such an opponent, your geo will not associate winning and losing with the battle, they will associate it with you because you have not battled with them in a while."
Stubborn geo
- mem[battle: true, battle:true, battle:true,...]
- do not listen

Geos can choose their own moves to use
- prefer light: no attack moves
- prefer dark: no support or defense moves
