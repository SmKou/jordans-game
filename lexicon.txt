Pe'um: A person or humanoid.

Geo: A creature that transitions at will between a living totem and its mobile form. They do not require food or drink, and do not reproduce, instead subsisting on and so gathering around memo (m'm). They have battle stats, abilities, and traits. When they communicate, whether another geo, pe'um or fig, they can only pronounce single consonants and vowels.

Fig: A being made purely of memo, a charged substance akin to spirit or magic. They often serve a function to nature and while they appear to both geos and pe'um, they rarely engage with them beyond their function. They speak the formal language of geos that geos cannot fully pronounce (included in the following).
